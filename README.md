## Project Overview
This project, part of the University of Santa Barbara bootcamp, is a React-based To-Do List application. It's built to incorporate essential features for task management while utilizing the capabilities of React, including state management and component-based architecture:
- A dynamic and responsive user interface for adding, viewing, and managing tasks.
- Efficient state management to handle task addition, completion status, and sorting.
- Interactive features allowing users to add new tasks, mark them as completed, and sort the task list by 'Completed', 'Uncompleted', or 'All'.
## User Stories
- Adding New Tasks

As a user, I want to easily add new tasks to my to-do list. The app should provide a simple input field and a submission button. Upon entering a task and clicking 'Add', the task should appear in my list immediately.

- Marking Tasks as Completed

As a task-oriented individual, I need to mark tasks as completed once I finish them. Each task should have a checkbox that, when checked, visually distinguishes the task as completed (e.g., strikethrough text). This helps in tracking my progress.

- Sorting Tasks

To better organize my tasks, I want the ability to sort my list. The app should offer filters to view all tasks, only completed tasks, or only uncompleted tasks. This feature will help me focus on tasks that require immediate attention.


## Ideas for Future Improvement
- Implementing a due date feature for each task and reminders for overdue tasks.
- Adding user authentication to allow users to save and access their tasks across different devices.
- Integrating with productivity tools like calendars and note-taking apps for comprehensive task management.
